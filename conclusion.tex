The sensitivity of the LIGO interferometers continues to improve, almost monthly,
due to a large concentrated effort by the detector commissioning team. The
noise floor has been reduced by 6 orders of magnitude in the last few years
and is now less than a factor of 10 away from the initial sensitivity goals.

Vital to the noise reduction effort has been the modeling of the interferometer's
response to noise coming from all significant sources.

A simple analysis has been done of two months of data from one of the LIGO science
runs for damped sinusoid signals. The sensitivity of the detectors to this type
of signal was seen to be degraded by the non-Gaussian noise character of the
interferometers and there are good ideas for future work.

A number of options have been outlined for near term upgrades to the interferometer.
It is expected that implementing these fixes would let us exploit the true
astrophysical reach of these instruments, surpassing the initial expectations
of the sensitivity by a factor of 3.
